## Wikipedia Attractor Crawler that prints "linked list"

This parses wikipedia by following the first link on every page until it gets to "Greek language".  I've long heard the rumors and wanted to try it for myself, turns out it actually works.

It prinks the characters at specific indices on the content of the ending page, which, at the moment, spell "LinkedList NYC".
